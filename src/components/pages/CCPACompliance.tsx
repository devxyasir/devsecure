          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-8 mb-4">1. Introduction to CCPA</h2>
          <p>
            The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a state statute intended to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California. Intelliphic is committed to complying with the CCPA and protecting the privacy rights of California residents.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-8 mb-4">2. Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            Under the CCPA, California residents have the right to know what personal information is collected about them. Intelliphic may collect the following categories of personal information:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 mb-4">
            <li>Identifiers (name, email address, IP address)</li>
            <li>Commercial information (products purchased, service usage)</li>
            <li>Internet activity (browsing history, search history)</li>
            <li>Geolocation data</li>
            <li>Professional or employment-related information</li>
            <li>Inferences drawn from other personal information</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-8 mb-4">3. Your Rights Under CCPA</h2>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-cyan-300 mt-6 mb-2">3.1 Right to Know</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-cyan-300 mt-6 mb-2">3.2 Right to Delete</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-cyan-300 mt-6 mb-2">3.3 Right to Opt-Out of Sale</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information. Intelliphic does not sell personal information in the traditional sense. However, under the CCPA's broad definition, some data sharing might be considered a "sale." We provide a "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" option to ensure compliance.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-cyan-300 mt-6 mb-2">3.4 Right to Non-Discrimination</h3>
          <p>
            We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. We will not:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 mb-4">
            <li>Deny you goods or services</li>
            <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services</li>
            <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services</li>
            <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-8 mb-4">4. How to Exercise Your Rights</h2>
